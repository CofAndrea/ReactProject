# React Project
# Breathe.
## Description.

A simple single page application developed using Vite/React that is intended to use for long or short(minimum 5 minutes) meditation breaks. The music does not start automatically just because i find annoying when audio plays without a choice from the user. I added a simple audio interface in the bottom-right corner if anyone want to listen to the audio track which is looped. The only sound users cannot control is the one played when the timer reaches 0:00. I picked 4 random breathing routine that you can stick to if you want to try concentrate on your breathing, they are chosen randomly when the start button is clicked and when the timer is reset.
